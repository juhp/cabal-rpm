Name:                cabal-rpm
Version:             2.1.0
Synopsis:            RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages
Description:
    This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages.
    .
    cabal-rpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.
    It can rpmbuild packages, yum/dnf install their dependencies, prep packages,
    and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and
    missing dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file with
    a freshly generated one, the update command updates the spec file to latest
    version from Stackage or Hackage, and the refresh command updates the spec
    file to the current cabal-rpm packaging. It also handles Hackage revisions of
    packages. Standalone packages can also be made, built with cabal-install.
