- lts downgrades for older branches
- support internal libs: eg dns-internal
- fix lts package version check to ignore old snapshot results
- diff misses flags in subpackages: eg skylighting-core
- cabal-tweak-drop-dep "ignored" by update etc
- switch to v2 commands
- subpackage deps for testsuite: eg QuickCheck's splitmix
- if not revised then update .orig should not be revised
- revised not revise! (always assume revise)
- use .Cblrpm/ for refresh?
- delete unrevised .cabal?
- changelog for subpkg bumps
- update --stream should add --stream to header
- cleanup .Cblrpm
- update/diff should remove dropped subpackages
- check krb5 ticket before attempting source upload

- --without-tests/--disable-tests/--no-tests (also for install etc)
  - or default to no tests and explicitly enable with --tests
  - can actually test for %bcond
* static subpackage versions (except update)
  - spec: don't upgrade subpackages
  - refresh: avoid checking subpackaging versions
  - spec: fixed/static subpackage versions (when checking for their deps)
- spec: cdeps for subpackages (example package?)
- tests tools dep going into deps (eg hspec-discover for network)

- for bin package --subpackage should add Prof deps for Devel deps
  (testcase: git-annex subpackage needs base-prof etc)

- local --stream: ignores stream

- hsp fragile - catch failure with clearer error

* builddep repeats looking for versions of missing packages
  https://github.com/juhp/cabal-rpm/issues/60

- `cblrpm update -s lts` runs cabal update, even when already latest!

* switch to Cabal 2 for better License handling

* drop dummy deps like fail, bytestring-builder and mtl-compat

- detect dropped subpkgs (eg here dropped in hledger-1.14.2)

- add rpmlint command

- only "cabal update" when needed

- support --without-prof and --without-haddock

- merge refresh and update specs generation

- spec --bounds
- rework "BR: ghc-*-static" with %{?_isa}
- move Main to app?
- check for cabal executable
- revisions of subpackages
- use Set for deps?

wrote the complete spec file atomically

## Misc
? run "cabal update" if package-version not found
- use <> instead of ++

# Commands
- fetch
- aliases for missingdeps
- allow cmd abbreviations?

## spec/packaging
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")
? use repoquery for missing testdeps
- support tarballs again
- handle ghc-lzma -> lzma!
- --releasever option (for repoquery)
- --no-revision
- add demo/ & example[s]/ to doc subpackage (gtk2hs)

## version ranges
- warn about missing dependencies/versions

## standalone
- packaging of lib stacks into one deployable rpm
* support building standalone package including missing deps
  - phase 2: embed src tarballs of missing deps?

## local
- --no-network
- llvm flag
- running "cabal-rpm local pkg-ver" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists builds old pkg

## update
- warm about new missing deps
- reverse deps and rebuilds
? update subpkg sources
- depsort sources

## depends
- dependency graphs or sorted recursive deps
- reverse dependencies
- use su -c when no sudo ??
  - any way to know if user is sudoer?

## koji/buildsys
- support mock builds
- copr support?
- scratch builds

## diff
- ignore whitespace option
- diff two versions
- --ignore
- --ignore-common (Release:, etc)
